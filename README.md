VR Retinal Disease Simulator:
- A virtual reality-based educational tool that simulates the visual effects of various retinal diseases. Built using Unity and OpenCV, this system provides an immersive, real-time experience to help users understand how vision is impacted by different retinal conditions.

Project Overview:
- This project simulates 12 common retinal diseases through visual distortions applied to the userâ€™s view in VR. Each disease effect is adjustable via sliders to represent different stages of progression. It is designed for medical education, patient awareness, and vision research.

Key Features:
- Real-time simulation of diseases
- Slider-based control for disease severity/progression
- Implemented in Unity with OpenCV-based image processing
- Educational use-case for students, doctors, and patients
- VR headset compatible for immersive experience

Technologies Used:
- Unity (Game engine)
- OpenCV (Image processing)
- C# (Scripting)
- XR Interaction Toolkit (for VR interaction)
- VR SDKs (e.g., Oculus or OpenXR)
